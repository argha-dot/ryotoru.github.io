Hi! My name is Himanshu, and I am currently looking for funded research positions in cryptography.

**This is my personal journal.** For the past year, I have been studying the properties of lattices and their role in post-quantum cryptography as a research assistant at [Ashoka University](https://www.ashoka.edu.in). What began as a curious Google search to understand end-to-end encryption has now led me here.

My main area of interest is the role of lattices in privacy-focused domains such as Lattice-Based Zero-Knowledge Proofs [(link)](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/284) and the similarities between Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Multi-Party Computation [(MPC)] (https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/981). Although I am also keen on exploring the complexity aspects of cryptography, may the crypto gods bless us!

I also enjoy tinkering with any piece of tech, prying open parts to see how they work. In my free time, you might find me hanging out with street dogs, browsing absurd Reddit pages, or scratching my head over how I lost another chess match from a winning position (yes, it’s a talent few possess).

Currently, my time is divided into the following activities:

1. **Job Hunting**
2. **Reading these papers:**
   - [TFHE Public-Key Encryption Revisited](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/603)
   - [Classical Hardness of Learning with Errors](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.0281)
   - [Fundamentals of Fully Homomorphic Encryption – A Survey](https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2018/125/)
3. **Improving my Rust skills** 

If our interests align and you are seeking an inquisitive, hardworking collaborator who loves bouncing off ideas and engaging in long discussions, I would love to hear from you. Feel free to reach out to me at [my mail](himaanshu216@gmail.com).
