Welcome to CryptiCosmos! I am Himanshu, currently a research assistant in the Department of Computer Science at Ashoka University, under the guidance of Dr. Debayan Gupta. My work focuses mainly on understanding the fundamentals of  lattice-based cryptography, traceability in end-to-end encrypted messaging. I also serve as the teaching fellow for both Dr. Debayan Gupta and Dr. Subhashis Banerjee.

My primary area of interest is lattice-based post-quantum cryptography, enhancing the security properties of end-to-end encryption and improving Internet privacy and data protection policies. I am particularly driven to address various challenges associated with E2EE platforms, such as contact discovery, anonymous registration, and originator tracing.  My aim is to contribute to making Internet policies and data protection practices more accessible to the wider public.

Additionally, I have a strong fascination for computational topology and its potential applications across diverse domains such as cryptography and computational neuroscience. I also like to tinker with hardwares to understand their mechanisms, try to break them down and rebuild them.
