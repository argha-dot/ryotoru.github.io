Welcome to CryptiCosmos! I am Himanshu, a research assistant in the Department of Computer Science at Ashoka University, working under Dr. Debayan Gupta. My research focuses on lattice-based cryptography and enhancing the security of end-to-end encrypted messaging.

My primary interests include lattice-based post-quantum cryptography, improving Internet privacy, and data protection policies. I am particularly driven to address challenges in E2EE platforms, such as contact discovery and originator tracing. Additionally, I have a fascination for computational topology and its applications in cryptography and neuroscience.

This website is mainly for sharing my notes and insights on the topics I am currently working on.
