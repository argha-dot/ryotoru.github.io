# Useful Research Links

Here are some of the links I frequently use for my research:

- [Lattice-Based Zero-Knowledge Proofs](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/284)
- [Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) Overview](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/981)
- [Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data](https://www.sdss.org/)
- [Cryptography and Privacy-Related Publications](https://eprint.iacr.org/)

Feel free to explore these resources for more insights into cryptography.
